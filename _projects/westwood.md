**Overview**  
Implemented Westwood BR and modified the congestion window updation algorithm and monitored for change in performance.

**Key Points**

- Implemented Westwood BR congestion control algorithm according to the research paper.
- Made small modifications to the algorithm by adding an extra level that further controls the window size according
  to the traffic level.
- Afterwards, monitored the throughput, drop rate and window size change in various wireless networks.
- The modified algorithm performed better than base Westwood and Newreno in almost all cases. The change in
  window size was more varied than Westwood but more conservative than Newreno.

**Tech Stack**

- C++, NS2, Bash
