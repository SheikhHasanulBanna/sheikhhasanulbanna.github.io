**Overview**  
Implemented basic Christofide's algorithm for TSP, simulated annealing, and a new method called **Randomized Christofide's Algorithm** which performed better the other algorithms for some graphs.

**Key Points**

- Took a large dataset of graphs and implemented the basic Christofide’s algorithm of TSP.
- Then imlemented simulated annealing and measured the completion time on different tsp datasets.
- Also implemented a randomized Christofide’s algorithm, that performed better than other algorithms for some
  graphs.

**Tech Stack**

- Python
