Under supervision of **Dr. Rezwana Reaz**  
• **My Contribution**: Conducted a survey on two groups for observing how they perceive the use of blockchain
technology in Digital Financial services in terms security and usability. Then used Mann-Whitney U test to perform
quantitative analysis to find out if they perceived any difference. Then concluded that the use of blockchain had a
positive impact on perceived security but no significant difference was found for perceived usability.
