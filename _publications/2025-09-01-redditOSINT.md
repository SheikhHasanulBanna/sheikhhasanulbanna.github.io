Under supervision of **Dr. Md. Shohrab Hossain**

* We created a synthesized dataset from scrapped reddit posts.
* Then Applied fine-tuned LLM models to provide
  verdict regarding if the posts contained potential vulnerabilities.
* Small models like DistilBERT, TinyBERT performed with high accuracy in providing verdicts
* These small models can be used to quickly identify if any new post contains information regarding new vulnerabilities.
