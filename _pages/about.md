I have completed my BSc. degree from the **[Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/)** at  **[Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET)](https://www.buet.ac.bd/web/#/)** , the leading engineering University of Bangladesh. Currently, I am working as a full-time lecturer in the department of CSE,  **[Presidency University, Bangladesh](http://www.presidency.edu.bd/)** .

I have a strong interest in the intersection of  **Network** &  **Software Security** , and **Machine Learning** to solve real world problems. I‚Äôm also keen on exploring  **Natural Language Processing** and **Blockchain Technolog**y. During my undergraduate studies, I undertook a thesis titled  **‚ÄúPeople‚Äôs Perception on the Security and Usability of Blockchain Technology in Digital Financial Services in Bangladesh‚Äù**, under the guidance of [Dr. Rezwana Reaz (BUET)](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/rezwana) in collaboration with  [Dr. Sadia Sharmin](https://cse.buet.ac.bd/faculty/faculty_detail/sadia) (BUET). This research allowed me to gain insight into blockchain technology, how different blockchain technologies can be used for digital financial services and also let me understand how people perceive the use of such technology. My Interest in analyzing and understanding the interaction of security, networks and systems grew immensely through this thesis. My thesis was published in [International Conference on Human-Computer Interaction](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-92823-9_20). After my graduation, I worked on developing an OSINT using Reddit and machine learning models under the supervision of **[Professor Dr. Md. Shohrab Hossain (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y89HApwAAAAJ&hl=en)**. I, along with my co-author, created a synthesized dataset from scrapped reddit posts. Then, we Applied LLM models to provide verdict regarding if the posts contained potential vulnerabilities. We found out that small models like DistilBERT, TinyBERT performed better than Llama, GPT etc. These small models can be used to identify if any new post contains information regarding new vulnerabilities. Our work has been accepted for publication at the **International Conference on Emerging Trends in Cybersecurity (ICETCS 2025).**

Now, I am applying my skills in an ML X Security project, detecting types of attacks and vulnerabilities from Reddit posts using RAG-based architecture. We are working under the supervision of **[Professor Dr. Md. Shohrab Hossain (BUET)](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=y89HApwAAAAJ&hl=en)**.

Apart from my research, I am also fortunate enough to contribute to the academic community through teaching. I‚Äôm currently the instructor of undergraduate-level courses on Computer Networks and Security, Digital Logic Design, Compiler Design, Data Structure and Algorithms etc.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I enjoy gaming, cycling, traveling, and watching sitcoms.
