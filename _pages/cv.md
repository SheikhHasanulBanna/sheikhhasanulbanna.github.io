## üíª Selected Projects

- **Integration of Attendance Record System into University‚Äôs Central Server** *(Bash, PuTTY, MySQL, PHP)*
  - Created automatic communication channel between fingerprint server and University‚Äôs EMS server.
  - Developed a bash script that migrates microsoft access db to MySQL db (complete automation with security
    credentials).
  - Used Putty to write and upload codes into the EMS server.
- **Implement and Modify WestwoodBR Congestion Control Algorithm** *(C++, NS2, Bash)*
  - *Implemented Westwood BR congestion control algorithm according to the research paper.*
  - *Made small modifications to the algorithm by adding an extra level that further controls the window size according
    to the traffic level.*
  - *Afterwards, monitored the throughput, drop rate and window size change in various wireless networks.*
  - *The modified algorithm performed better than base Westwood and Newreno in almost all cases. The change in
    window size was more varied than Westwood but more conservative than Newreno*
- **MKLOGA Keyboard Layout Optimization Extended for Bangla Keyboard** *(Perl, Python, PyTorch)*
  - A bangla keyboard layout optimization using carpalx fitness function, genetic algorithm and deep learning.
  - Initially, the default layout for Bijoy is given. The model is trained to be able to calculate fitness function.
  - A corpus of bangla wikipedia article was given to train and then the genetic algorithm on a deep network was run to
    find fitness values for each newly generated layout.
  - When better layouts were not found for a few iterations, the process would stop and we would get our desired
    keyboard layout..
- **Discover Hidden Contents in Websites using Gobuster** *(Gobuster, Go)*
  - Used the Gobuster tool to find hidden directories under forbidden paths in multiple websites
  - Extracted hidden files from Google Cloud and Amazon S3 buckets.
  - Extracted API keys and server configurations from hidden json files.
- **Travelling Salesman Problem: Implementation and Modification** *(Python)*
  - Took a large dataset of graphs and implemented the basic Christofide‚Äôs algorithm of TSP.
  - Then imlemented simulated annealing and measured the completion time on different tsp datasets.
  - Also implemented a randomized Christofide‚Äôs algorithm, that performed better than other algorithms for some
    graphs.
- **Medist ‚Äî Medicine Info & Appointment System** *(React, Express.js, Tailwind, PostgreSQL, Puppeteer)*
  - A System where people can search for information regarding medicines and get appointments with doctors via
    google meet.
  - Uses Web Scrapping tool (puppeteer) to crawl website and get medicine info.
  - Implemented Microservice architecture and Used RabitMQ for communication among the services.
  - Used Postgresql for database.
  - Used Typescript with ExpressJS, React
  - Implemented prescription PDF generation.
- **Building Compiler from Scratch** *(YACC, Bison, C++, Flex)*
  - Built all 4 main functionalities of a compiler from scratch.
  - Symbol table generation using C++.
  - Lexical analyzer using Flex
  - Syntax and Semantics analyzer using Flex and Bison.
  - Finally used Bison (Yacc) to build intermediate code that can run on Emu 8086.
- **Canteen Food Ordering System using Microcontroller** *(Python, Arduino C++, MySQL)*
  - Using Arduino Mega, RFID reader, and messaging system built a small token-based food ordering system.
  - Used Python and Aduino C++ for communication between hardware and database to verify token and then send
    message.
- **4-Bit MIPS Design using Atmega32 and ICs** *(Python, Assembly 8086)*
  - Using Python, generated instruction bits from assembly - 8086.
  - Using atmega32, sent instruction bits to the ICs to complete the instructions and save results in memory.
